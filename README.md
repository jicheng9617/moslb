# Multi-objective Stochastic Linear Bandits

The repository contains: 
- <\code>oracle.py<\code> to generate the environment for bandit problems with linear context;
- <\code>moslb.py<\code> provides bandit algorithms, including ParetoUCB, MOSLB-PC, and MOSLB-PL; 
- <\code>utils.py<\code> contains basic functions to judge the optimality under different preference.
