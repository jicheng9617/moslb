# Multi-objective Stochastic Linear Bandits

The repository contains: 
- 'oracle.py' to generate the environment for bandit problems with linear context;
- 'moslb.py' provides bandit algorithms, including ParetoUCB, MOSLB-PC, and MOSLB-PL; 
- 'utils.py' contains basic functions to judge the optimality under different preference.
